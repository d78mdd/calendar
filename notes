main loop, addMonths, addYear
should work
  for 3 years
  for 2 years
  for more years
  for 1 year for several months

  for 2 months

  for 1 month

addMonth
should work for
  1 month inside 1 year
  2 months inside 1 year
  middle months



exact difference should be fine for
  entire middle years
  entire middle months
  the one-month case
  first month
  last month , while adding +1


line 288 - ok, now 290











for another version:
- choose an algo for default values

- choose specific default values

( - count hours, minutes, seconds)

- maybe should not use functions and should not pass params
- maybe the 2 "month" functions can become 1
- maybe the 1 main loop and the 1 in addMonths can be abstracted away into one functionality
- maybe everything can be done with less code   ?








during one date difference calculation exactly one or zero swaps should occur
