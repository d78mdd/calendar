if start year is higher than end year
then swap  the objects

..

if start month is higher than end month   and they are in the same year
then swap  the objects

..

if start day is higher than end day and if they are in the same month   and in the same year
then swap  the objects










for another version:
- choose an algo for default values

- choose specific default values

( - count hours, minutes, seconds)






?
if an exact start date is entered and only a month for an end
and that month is smaller than the start date
it should First do a swap and then defaults

so


at this point should first have some version of two triplets be them valid dates or not; done
they don't have to be final; ok

then
first default the years; done
swap if needed
then default the months
swap if needed and if in same year
finally default days
and swap if needed and if in same year and month

during one date difference calculation exactly one or zero swaps should occur
